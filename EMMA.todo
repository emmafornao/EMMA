EMMA (Emma's Mod Manager for Ark: Survival Ascended):
    ✔ add selected row to favourites when toggle favourites button is clicked @done(25-09-09 23:14)
    ☐ uninstall all: pop-up dialog to confirm
    ☐ don't add to favourites when looking at a different tab
    ☐ add "remove dynamic cosmetics" and maybe also add this info to view (not favourites though since it's situational?)
    ☐ add category info?
    ☐ option to load all items into table - can this be done dynamically?
    ☐ fix toggle_favourite to use the right model (selected_index.model()?) and also remove the mod selected in favourites when it is toggled there and not otherwise
        maybe it's better to have separate buttons to add or remove in each tab as the user can't see whether a mod was already added or not while in the installed tab
