## **E**mma's **M**od **M**anager for **A**rk: Survival Ascended (**EMMA**)

EMMA is being built with a focus on easy mod reinstalls and maintaining a favourites list. The ingame browser of ASA doesn't support favourites and somewhere in the download process, mods tend to get corrupted, so a full reinstall of mods isn't uncommon. While your main mods might be redownloaded when joining a server (which isn't recommended currently as this can cause further mod corruption), custom cosmetics are optional and have to manually be installed again one by one in the very unresponsive ingame browser. Curseforge's own application doesn't support ASA so here we are.

Once the previously mentioned features are implemented, the UI is refined and the tool works well, turning it into a more full-fledged mod manager that allows for mod installations (rather than just reinstalling what was previously installed) and browsing available mods may be considered. For now though, consider this more of a maintenance and logging tool so you don't have to physically write down your favourite custom cosmetics.
